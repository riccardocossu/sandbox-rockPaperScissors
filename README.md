sandbox-rockPaperScissors
=========================

Just a quick mockup of a very simple groovy implemented console rock paper scissors


To try it out just move to rockPaperScissors directory and:

```
mvn clean package
java -jar target/rockPaperScissors-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

It only requires Java 1.7 and maven to try.
